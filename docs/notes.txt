-1pt for "ignoring globals in C interface?"
    to avoid? there's something on moodle for that, I guess
-1pt for storing in posets more than 1 instance of specific string??
    to avoid? ..
interface file:
    include guards (seem. actual, not #pragma once)
    name mangling? -> extern "C" in include for a proper C interface
    namespaces?
    bool: different in C and C++, like #ifdef _cplusplus?? 
    also, different libraries (like <cstdlib> and <stdlib.h>)
also,
    use .find instead of .at, if used .find prev.
    anonymous namespaces -> allows to hide stuff from "meta-global" namespace
:: NDEBUG need only toggle cerr? and assert, nothing more
on unordered containers: yes?
no pollution in .h, like using namespace;
